# Feature Flags Manager

**Feature Flags Manager** is a tool designed to streamline the management of feature flags in your projects. It automates the synchronization of feature states between your codebase and documentation in Confluence, enabling teams to easily track the status of features and ownership responsibilities.

## Why is this important?

In large projects, the number of active features can grow quickly, making it harder to keep track of them.  
**Feature Flags Manager** helps to:  
- Keep feature flag statuses consistent between repositories and documentation.  
- Avoid confusion about which team is responsible for each feature.  
- Automatically mark deleted features to preserve their history.  

This tool is particularly useful for:  
- **Developers**: To better understand which features are active.  
- **DevOps teams**: To simplify the process of updating feature flags.  
- **Product Managers**: To track feature progress and responsible teams.  

## How does it work?

1. **Automatic status updates**: The tool fetches feature flag data from GitLab and updates the table in Confluence.  
2. **Manual ownership updates**: Teams can add or modify ownership information without overwriting statuses.  
3. **Marking deleted features**: Deleted flags are marked with a "Deleted" status to avoid losing their history.  

## Use Case Example

**Scenario:** Your team adds a new feature and activates its flag in the code. You want to ensure that the flagâ€™s status is reflected in Confluence, and the responsible team is aware of it.  

1. Run the `Feature Flags Manager` script.  
2. The table in Confluence is automatically updated with the latest statuses.  
3. Your team adds its name to the corresponding row in the table.  

**Result:** You always have up-to-date information about feature statuses and their ownership.

2. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Technical Overview

### How It Works

The **Feature Flags Manager** integrates with GitLab and Confluence APIs to synchronize feature flag statuses and ownership information. Below is a high-level overview of its workflow:  

1. **Fetching Data**:  
   - The script connects to GitLab using its API.  
   - It retrieves the list of active and deleted feature flags from the specified project repositories.  

2. **Processing Data**:  
   - The fetched flags are compared with the existing data in Confluence.  
   - Updates are identified for flags that have changed status, ensuring accuracy.  

3. **Updating Confluence**:  
   - The tool interacts with the Confluence API to update the feature flags table.  
   - If a feature is deleted, the tool marks its status as "Deleted" but retains its history.  
   - Ownership data added manually by teams remains untouched.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - The script handles API connection failures, invalid credentials, and other runtime exceptions gracefully, ensuring reliability.

### Key Components

- **GitLab API Integration**:  
  Uses the GitLab REST API to fetch feature flag data. This requires:  
  - A personal access token with `read_api` permissions.  
  - The GitLab project ID(s) to monitor.  

- **Confluence API Integration**:  
  Updates and modifies the feature flags table in Confluence. This requires:  
  - An Atlassian account with permissions to edit pages in the specified Confluence space.  
  - The ID of the Confluence page containing the feature flags table.  

- **Data Mapping**:  
  Each feature flag is mapped by its unique identifier (key) to ensure updates are applied to the correct rows in the table.  

### Installation and Configuration

1. **Setup API Tokens**:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory:  
     ```plaintext
     GITLAB_TOKEN=your_gitlab_personal_access_token
     CONFLUENCE_USER=your_email@example.com
     CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=your_confluence_api_token
     CONFLUENCE_SPACE=TS
     CONFLUENCE_PAGE_ID=123456789
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed.  
   - Install required libraries using `pip`:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  

3. **Run the Script**:  
   Execute the main script to perform a synchronization:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
